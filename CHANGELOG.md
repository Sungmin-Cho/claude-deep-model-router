# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-08-18 (design and pricing audit)

### Added

- `large_context` now decides a binding: a task carrying it routes `worker_balanced` to the Claude balanced seat, because the xAI seat re-bills the whole request at double rate past 200K input tokens and its window ends 500K earlier.
- The registry records the xAI long-context price tier and context window, and the model profile states the comparison as the conditional one it is.

### Fixed

- `local_policy` values are validated, not only their key names: an unknown effort level was reported as an applied floor while being silently ignored, and a non-numeric tier crashed with the status reserved for internal errors. Both are invalid input (exit 2) now.
- The CLI locator resolves in its documented order — env, root, Claude cache, Codex cache — instead of letting `.codex` win by alphabetical accident, picks the highest version by number rather than by string (`1.9.0` used to beat `1.10.0`), and refuses a source checkout on every tier rather than only the first.
- `dispatch_agent.py status` on an unknown attempt id answers with one sentence and exit 2, like `cancel`, instead of a traceback.
- Documentation drift against the policy file: the REVIEW/CRITICAL worker, the missing `concurrency_sensitive` override, and the missing `termination_unconfirmed` operational flag.
- README now states the PyYAML requirement and that the human-gate exit status is configurable over 3..255.

### Removed

- `review.MEDIUM.reviewer_count` and `review.MEDIUM.prefer_cross_family`: both were read and neither had any effect. The behaviour they described is unchanged and now documented as the constant it always was.
- Three `effort_by_work` entries nothing selected, and an unused `implementation_role` task field.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Corrected Claude Sonnet 5 list price to $2 / $10 after that introductory rate became the permanent published price.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-08-17

### Added

- First public release of the shared decision plane for Claude Code, Codex, and Grok.
- Skill-driven classification plus a deterministic scorer that emits a RouteDecisionV1 (band, worker, effort, review policy, honest independence).
- RouteRequestV1 file input, local-policy merge, and availability-aware fallbacks that never drop a HIGH or CRITICAL floor.
- Background dispatch supervisor with a wall-clock deadline, process-group kill ladder, and a completion receipt distinct from isolation evidence.
- Host-neutral CLI locator that refuses sibling source trees and personal skill symlinks.
- Public plugin surface matching the rest of deep-suite: bilingual README and CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, and LICENSE.
